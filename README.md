# Spotify Native Toggler

**Control Spotify playback seamlessly without switching windows**

</div>

## Overview

Spotify Native Toggler is a lightweight, cross-platform desktop application that enables you to control Spotify playback from any application, ensuring uninterrupted focus during work, gaming, or multitasking.

## Purpose

Windows 11 lacks a universal media controller, making it challenging to manage music playback when:

- Engaged in gaming sessions
- Focused on coding or other intensive tasks
- Working across multiple applications

This tool provides quick access to Spotify controls via global keyboard shortcuts, keeping your workflow smooth.
